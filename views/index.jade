      | orn on the latest of nights when all was well in the world as we enjoyed the fine taste of a stout
      | and the even finer company of friends, we have compiled a list of some of the most classic rules created
      | by the most tyrannical of kings. Some clever, original rules devised by kings a bit more devilish have also
      | been included for your amusement. For the sake of spontaneity, these rules are available in random order, 
      | awaiting only your curiosity.

      | If you have ideas of your own that have been proven successful amongst your own nobles, perhaps you should
      | consider <a href="/rules/new">suggesting</a> it to us. Those deemed worthy will be drafted into our official rules,
      | for all of the world to find and make the fondest of memories. 
    P 
      | Cheers, and may the most heavenly of beers be yours to savor.
